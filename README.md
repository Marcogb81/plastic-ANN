# plastic-ANN
Artificial Neural Network with neuronal plasticity, where the input is analyzed for get a stress threshold and 
give a variable where change the number of neurons in hidden layer, recomputed in real time the neuronal population 
and enhanced the capacity of ANN itself, in this case we apply to computer vision.
